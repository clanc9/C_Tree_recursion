# C_Tree_recursion
Exercise to draw a Christmas tree using a recursive function

Developed in February 2018 as an exercise to test the ability to write recursive algorithms in C
--------------------------------------------------
Given a numerical argument n, draw a Christmas tree comprising n segments, starting with 4 branches for the uppermost segment.
The number of branches increments by 1+((segment number-1)/2) for each additional segment.
The width of a branch is width+2 of the upper branch, except when a new segment is formed, in which case the width is width-2 of the upper branch.
The trunk of the tree is of width n if n is odd, else n+1.
